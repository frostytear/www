  title: Measuring the impact of your documentation
  year: '2018'
- abstract: "<p>THE PROBLEM:</p>\n<p>Many tech startups and young companies suffer\
    \ from this one illness: inability to provide easy steps of installing their platform\
    \ to the customers. This is especially the case if their product depends on armada\
    \ of 3rd party dependencies. Customers expect a one-click install where they are\
    \ provided with 50+ pages of highly technical documentation. Some customers love\
    \ the verbosity but others are driven away by it. To satisfy both extremes, we\
    \ made every example command in docs copy-pastable. If customers just copy and\
    \ paste every command from documentation they will end up with working single-machine\
    \ platform. This, however, does not solve the vast effort needed in testing the\
    \ docs for each release.</p>\n<p>HOW WE SOLVED IT:</p>\n<p>OK, so everything is\
    \ copy paste-able. Why not automate copy-pasting? And that's basically what we\
    \ did. In joint tech-writer team and dev team effort, we came up with a process\
    \ that allows for quick functional testing of the documentation. Furthermore,\
    \ we developed a general purpose tool that can simply run every command from documentation\
    \ and also allow input parameters. This is how we've shortened testing time of\
    \ install docs from 50 man-hours to about 45 minutes, shortened POC time from\
    \ couple of weeks to a few days and have satisfied wide range of customers by\
    \ maintaining only a single documentation file - no devops and consultants needed!</p>\n\
    <p>THE TALK:</p>\n<p>In my talk I'd like to present the journey, the process and\
    \ the benefits of strong dev and tech-writing teams cooperation. I will clearly\
    \ present our practices and approach to both documenting complex installation\
    \ paths and automatically testing the same as well as using your existing documentation\
    \ as source of automation.</p>"

    \ content or a lack of a clear strategy, that sort of thought doesn\u2019t just\
    \ exist for the documentation editors. Our readers see it too, and it leads to\
    \ confused support requests or a loss of customers.</p>\n<p>While at Joyent, I\
    \ consistently was made aware of documentation that needed help and at first it\
    \ was a constant firefight. Over time, I was able to quell the fires, create a\
    \ content strategy, and completely redefine how documentation works. From this\
    \ experience, as well as time spent managing a technical blog, I\u2019ve learned\
    \ it\u2019s all about strategy. </p>\n<p>In this talk, we\u2019ll discuss:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>how to get buy-in for a blow up with a rewrite proposal</li>\n<li>content\
    \ strategy (and how to write a great one)</li>\n<li>empathy for our readers</li>\n\
    <li>setting easy-to-follow guidelines for non-writers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019\
    ll also cover how to think about this work when you don\u2019t have budget support\
    \ or a team to help execute the changes needed. </p>"
